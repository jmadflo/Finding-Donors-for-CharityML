# Finding-Donors-for-CharityML
- This is my second Udacity Machine Learning Engineer nanodegree project.

- To view my work, open the finding_donors_charityml.ipynb file. The rest are supporting files or less readable formats of the same work.

- As the name suggests, this Supervised Learning project is centered on the creation of a machine learning model capable of determining the whether an individual makes more than $50,000 per year using publicly available information. This would help the charity determine whether to solicity a donation from an individual and what ammount to ask for.

- This Jupyter Notebook project is comprised of Python code blocks with my contributions including the word 'Implementation' in the section header, and with the 'TODO' keyword in the comments preceding my code contribution. 

- Furthermore, there are 8 conceptual questions that I have answered thoroughly and demonstrate my understanding of the data and the work that I engaged in with it.

# Main Concepts
- The main machine learning concepts covered in this project include the following:

- Data Exploration: This included feature exploration and determining the total number of people that make over $50,000 per year and what proportion that is of the total population in the dataset. 
- Model Preparation: This included data preprocessing and label encoding transform the data into a form that is more optimal for the model's learning.
- Evaluating Model Performance: Selected 3 different algorithms to build models with and determined the performance of each one in order to determine which of the three candidates to select for my final model.
- Improving Results: Provided justification for my algorithm selection, and explained the structure of the final model in simple terms. Then did some hyper-parameter tuning and evaluated the performance of my new and improved model.
- Feature Importance: Determined which features from the dataset were good predictors of income and which were not. Was able to quantify the importance of each feature and was able to rank them by importance.
